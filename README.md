**Codes for paper:**
[DeepSQA: Understanding Sensor Data via Question Answering(IoTDI 2021)](https://github.com/nesl/DeepSQA/blob/master/DeepSQA-paper.pdf)

Raw sensory data "OPPORTUNITY" can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/opportunity+activity+recognition)


### Environment:
- Python 3.7.7
- Nvidia RTX Titan
- Related packages: see "requirements.txt"
----


### Create folders to perform simulation:
```
mkdir sqa_data trained_models result source_dataset
```


## Files description:

-  __source_dataset:__ 
	- __opportunity:__ put [raw sensory data "OPPORTUNITY"](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/226/opportunity+activity+recognition.zip) here.
-  __sqa_data_gen:__ 
	- __question_family.ipynb:__ specifies all the question family templates used in generation
	- __question_family.json:__ stores the question family info in a json file.
	- __data_extraction.py:__ functions for extracting/splitting source data; generating scene_list; and visualizing data.
	- __dataset_analysis.py__ class of sqa dataset, used for analyzing the statistics.
	- __function_catalog.py:__ atomic function catalog
	- __functional_program.py:__ function programs associated with all question families
	- __question_generation.py:__ question generation function----given a sence, generate all questions of different families.
	- __sqa_gen_engine.py:__ question generation machine. Main program
	- __synonym_change.py:__ change words in generated question to increase linguistic variations.
	- __train_opp_model-single.ipynb:__ trains DL models on opp dataset natively. Trained model used in Neural Symbolic method.

-  __preprocess_data:__ 
	- create folders: ``mkdir embeddings glove``
	- __embeddings:__ folder storing embedding matrix and word index
	- __glove:__ folder storing pretrained glove pre-trained word vectors. Downloaded from [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). ([glove.6B.zip](https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip))
	- __embedding.py:__  create embedding matrix
	- __prepare_data.py:__ get sensory, question, and answer data in matrix form
	- __preprocessing.py:__ main function for converting a SQA dataset in json into processed .npz format.

-  __sqa_models:__ 
	- __mac_model:__ codes for DeepSQA-CA model (mac)
	- __baselines.py:__ codes for all other baseline models (prior, prior_q, SAN, conv-lstm, etc)
	- __run_baselines.py:__ training and testing baseline models 
	- __run_mac.py__ training and testing mac models

- __result_analysis:__ 
	- __utils.py:__ utility function for getting confusion matrix
	- __analyze_result.py:__ class for analyzing generated .pkl result.


- create folders: ``mkdir sqa_data trained_models result ``
-  __sqa_data:__ stores all the generated SQA data in json format, and aslo preprocessed data in .pkl and .npz format.
-  __trained_models:__ stores all the trained models. Models trained from a single simulation are stored in a single folder. e.g. "opp_sim1".
- __result:__ stores simulation result in .pkl form. e.g. "opp_sim1.pkl"

## Running experiments:
- __sqa_generation.py:__ scripts for generating the original SQA dataset. 
- __data_preprocessing.py:__ scripts for preprocess the original SQA dataset for training.
- __run_baselines&mac.py:__ codes for training either mac or baselines models.
- modify the parameters in the scripts for different simulation settings.
